# PlotLot
PlotLot is a GEN AI real estate developer used to help you assess a plot of lands zoning code, dimensions, and sqft to find the maximum allowable units.
## Inspiration
Everyone need/want a house at one point but it has been extremely difficult with the high interest rates and inflations. Recently, the FED just cut the interest rates down, thus, would drive up businesses, including the housing market. People would want to find properties to either reside or to generate money from it. This app would help users achieve that easier, From here this app would tell them if it is a good deal and would they generate benefits from putting in more units.
## What it does
This app essentially prompt the user to enter an address of a lot that they are interested in. Then it would provide them crucial data and inform if this lot is a good deal that would benefits the user financially base on the zoning which would allow them to know how many units they can put on the lot. It would also supply the user with a survey of the property that they are looking at with all the layouts, measurements.
## How we built it
1. User entering address.
       Show them information of the property

       Scrape website such as Zillow to get properties data, zoning
3. Agent
